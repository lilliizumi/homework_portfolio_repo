<h2>GROWTH MARKETER</h2>
<p>Several years ago, while on a trip to New York, my friend and I passed by a shop in Chelsea Marketplace that sold canvas bags with different catchphrases printed on them. She stopped in her tracks, pointed to one, and told me she was buying it for me because it was so fitting. On the bag were the words “I wish someone would follow me around and write down all the clever things I say.” Luckily, I’ve learned to hone these skills in a practical way and now manage to help businesses grow as a result.</p>
